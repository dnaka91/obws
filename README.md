Remote control OBS with the [obs-websocket] plugin from Rust ðŸ¦€.

[obs-websocket]: https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket

## Usage

Add `obws` to your project with `cargo add obws@0.13.0` or add it manually to your
`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
obws = "0.13.0"
```

In addition, you will need to use the latest [tokio](https://tokio.rs) runtime to use this library
as it makes heavy use of async/await and is bound to this runtime.

[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

### Example

Here we connect to a OBS instance, get some version information and log in to access the whole API
and lastly print out a list of available scenes.

For more usage instructions see the [docs](https://docs.rs/obws) or check out the
[examples](examples/README.md).

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use obws::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Connect to the OBS instance through obs-websocket.
    let client = Client::connect("localhost", 4455, Some("password")).await?;

    // Get and print out version information of OBS and obs-websocket.
    let version = client.general().version().await?;
    println!("{version:#?}");

    // Get a list of available scenes and print them out.
    let scene_list = client.scenes().list().await?;
    println!("{scene_list:#?}");

    Ok(())
}
```
